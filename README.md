# Automatic Install Windows

Install Windows automatically. 

Scripts that can be compiled into an iso, to be launched on the Windows installation screen

### Quick explanation: 

These are scripts in `.bat` format
You'll be able to install Windows with virtually complete automation.

A considerable time-saver for all VM players and test administrators.

You'll need to compile them into an `.iso` and either mount it or burn it (a simple copy on a usb can also work for other uses).

Don't worry, there'll be a tutorial on how to compile them in `.iso`.
